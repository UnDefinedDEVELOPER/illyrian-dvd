# Illyrian DVD - Development, Video, Design

**Illyrian DVD** is my personal portfolio, even though it's branded. This website was created with the purpose of _developing great solutions, solving problems and doing high-quality work for my clients_. Illyrian DVD showcases how I can help you grow your business, promote your brand and develop excellent products.

illyrianDVD is supposed to be a showcase of a fast and well-coded front-end project using modern web frameworks like AstroJS, Svelte, PostCSS and Vercel. The website is statically generated with the exception of specific UI components ('Astro Islands') that are hydrated after mounting. For more info check out [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build).
